Problem Statement
    In many applications, data is stored in deeply nested objects. Accessing a property from a deeply nested object requires multiple checks to avoid errors. Instead of manually checking each level, we need a function that safely retrieves a value from a nested object using a dot-separated key path.

Challenge
    Write a function that takes a nested object and a key path string (e.g., "user.address.city") and returns the value. If any part of the path is missing, return "Key not found".

Constraints
    • The input object should be valid.
    • The key path should be a string with dot notation (.) separating keys.
    • If a key is missing, return "Key not found".
    • The function should handle deeply nested objects.

// input :- obj = {user: {address: {city: "new york"}}} , keypath = user.address.city

// output - "new york"

function getNestedValue(obj, keyPath) {
    if(typeof(obj) === 'object' && typeof(keyPath) === 'string' && keyPath.includes('.')) {
        let keys = keyPath.split('.');
        let current = obj

        for(let key of keys) {
            if(current[key] === undefined) {
                return "Key not found"
            }
            current = current[key]
        }
        return current;
    }
}
